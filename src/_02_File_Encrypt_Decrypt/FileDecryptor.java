	 * Decryption is the process of taking encoded or encrypted text or other data
	 * and converting it back into text that you or the computer can read and understand.
	 *
	 * The shift cipher is decrypted by using using the key and shifting back up,
	 * at the end of our encryption example we had our alphabet as:
	 *
	 * e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d
	 *
	 * If we shift it back up by 4 based on the key we used the alphabet is decrypted:
	 *
	 * a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
	 *
	 * "Lipps Asvph" returns to "Hello World"
	 * 
	 * Create a program that opens the file created by FileEncryptor and decrypts
	 * the message, then display it to the user in a JOptionPane.
