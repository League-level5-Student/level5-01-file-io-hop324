	 * Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information
	 * in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and
	 * those who are not authorized cannot.
	 *
	 * A simple shift cipher works by shifting the letters of a message
	 * down based on a key. If our key is 4 then:
	 * 
	 * a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
	 * 
	 * becomes:
	 *
	 * e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d
	 * 
	 * "Hello World" changes to "Lipps Asvph"
	 *
	 * Create a program that takes a message and a key from the user.
	 * Use the key to shift each letter in the users input and save the final result to a file.
